The models presented in this section represent an overview of some approaches developed as part of my doctoral research. 
The informational documents are used solely to provide context on the problem and solution methodologies. Formal manuscripts 
have been developed around these models with the scientific rigor required for research work. These samples are presented to 
demonstrate my skills in the field of optimization but do not necessarily represent my complete research. 
I am happy to share the corresponding works if requested.

Note: The models were developed by me and have not been published; therefore, they should not be shared.
