The models presented in this section represent an overview of some of the 
approaches developed as part of my doctoral research. The informative papers 
are only used to give context to the problem and solution methodologies, however, 
formal manuscripts have been developed around these models with the scientific 
rigor required for research work. These work samples are presented in order to 
showcase my skills in the field of optimization but do not necessarily represent 
my complete research. I am happy to share the corresponding studies on request.
